Link to the application: https://culture-compass.netlify.app/map (it takes about 1 minute after starting the application until the application receives all the necessary data from the various microservices, if that doesn't work please refresh).

Features included in the project:
-  Fullstack Application
-  Design Patterns
-  Azure APIs and database (Spring and Postgres)
-  Leetify frontend (Angular app)
-  Google Maps API
-  Pipe and filter (creation of the initial database)
-  Figma prototypes
-  Conceptual, Execution and Implementation architecture
-  Docker

After the evaluation, parts of the application no longer work (such as the navigation system from one site to another) due to the shutdown of the Google API for the Angular component responsible for the map.
